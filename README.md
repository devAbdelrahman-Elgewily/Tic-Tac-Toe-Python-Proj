# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe AI (4x4x4)

This is a Python-based AI project for a 3D 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe game, where a human can play against a computer that uses the **Minimax algorithm** enhanced with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** and **Heuristic Evaluation** for optimal gameplay.

## üéØ Project Features

- **3D Board Support**: 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe board structure (64 cells).
- **AI Engine**:
  - **Minimax Algorithm**: Strategic move decision-making based on recursion.
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimized search to reduce unnecessary evaluations.
  - **Heuristic Evaluation Function**: Intelligent move scoring when the full game tree cannot be searched due to complexity.
- **Human vs AI Gameplay** via the console.
- **Customizable Search Depth** for balancing difficulty and performance.

## üß† How the AI Works

The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm to explore possible future moves and evaluate them using a custom heuristic when the depth limit is reached. Alpha-beta pruning significantly improves efficiency by cutting off branches that won‚Äôt affect the outcome.

### Heuristic Highlights

The heuristic function scores the board based on:
- Potential winning lines (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Blocking opponent lines
- Depth to terminal state (faster wins preferred)
